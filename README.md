# Startup-Octopus
Sometimes you just need a quick, online voting tool, whether it be annonymous or not, to settle any number of group situations. Trying to decide which movie to watch? Trying to pick where to go for dinner? Who in the room looks the most like Tom Cruise? The limits to what the basic voting tool could do is limitless. You can put timers and images to spice up some games, or make it annonymous if the subject might be sensitive. Make decisions and enjoy games together from OctoVote


My Startup Application
Some ideas for the project:
Maybe I should make something useful like a game or tool or something else
I think there are some habits I need to make to really make this tool effective, but I see some incredible potential. I also would love to understand a bit better how it works.
## New Plan for StartUp
I think my approach will be to construct a group study app, preferably with a plugin to gospel library, or else I will have to find a way to make it work. It will allow users to share insights from the text and to view them in a similar place. Likewise, I'd like to be able to export group notes back to gospel library, but that may not be entirely realistic for the alpha launch

From creating a webdomain and renting a server from AWS, Its impressive how simple they made it. 

# html on simon practice

Working on this, I feel more capable of using HTML. it feels more natural and intuitive, and I feel like if i needed to, I could write my next research paper using it.

# CSS simon and startup

start from the biggest things, and work your way down!!!!
json: "key"-value pairs
. for class
#: for ID
Padding around content
Border in the middle
margin is the outside
know array functions
map -> make array of equal size and 'map' everything over from 
remember .then syntax
chmod +x makes executable javascript

# javascript on simon

debugging can be really difficult. Flow can be difficult to visualize too. Break it down into how its going to go, and take it one step at a time. careful with promises since they run on the side. .then and async are both very useful to create flow in an out-of-sequence way. .then() => val is handy, and keep it simple stupid!!!!

# debugging CSS on startup

Breaking down the CSS and HTML elements is a biggest-> smallest relationship, so taking it from the biggest element to the smallest element is the best approach to getting it to make sense. Keep track of using body, dividing in to header, body, and footer, and divide those respectively using all of the tags. CSS will likewise break-down from biggest to smallest if you let it be so simple. Its backwards of how every other language works, but keep it in mind

# constructing JS on startup
Functions to implement:
login: basic take in username and spit it back on other pages
addNote: adds a note 
addNotebook: creates a new Notebook object?
share: adds users that should also have access to the account.


#Service endpoints on webapp:
Creating an effective web application is difficult, and using nodes has to be really intentional. Most code is pretty reusable for setting these things up too.

todo:
 - repair the  js file to construct classes and initialize them using db data pulled from mongo.
 - send notebooks to mongo
 - create account based priveledges
 - enable sharing
 - login capacity - Done!
 - a chat feature which is saved for each notebook, allowing conversation on given notes
